# Research Findings: PHASE II SPECIFICATION - FULL-STACK TODO WEB APPLICATION

**Date**: 2026-01-25

## Summary

Based on the detailed feature specification and the established project constitution, no explicit "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items were identified in the Technical Context of the implementation plan. The technologies, scope, and constraints are clearly defined, minimizing the need for extensive up-front research at this phase.

## Decisions & Rationale

-   **Decision**: Proceed without dedicated research tasks for "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items.
-   **Rationale**: The provided specification comprehensively covers the functional and non-functional requirements, and the technical stack is explicitly defined in the project constitution. This clarity reduces ambiguity and the necessity for further investigative research at this planning stage.

## Alternatives Considered

-   Generating research tasks for general best practices or deeper dives into selected technologies.
-   **Reason for Rejection**: While beneficial at later stages, introducing such broad research now would unnecessarily delay the core planning without resolving specific ambiguities critical to the current phase. Best practices will be integrated during the implementation phase by the AI agents as they generate code.
